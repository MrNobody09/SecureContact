# Secure Contact Management System

## Overview
The Secure Contact Management System is a web application developed to provide users with a secure platform to manage their contacts. Built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and various other libraries, this project aims to facilitate the organization and maintenance of contact information while prioritizing data privacy and security.

## Key Features
### 1. User Authentication and Authorization
- Users can register for an account and securely log in using their email and password.
- Passwords are securely hashed before being stored in the database to ensure confidentiality.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for user authentication, providing a secure means of accessing protected routes.
- Access to certain functionalities, such as creating, updating, or deleting contacts, is restricted to authenticated users.

### 2. Contact Management
- Users can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on their contact information.
- Contacts are organized based on user IDs, allowing each user to manage their own set of contacts securely.
- The application supports functionalities like adding new contacts, viewing existing contacts, updating contact details, and deleting contacts when necessary.

### 3. Error Handling and Validation
- Robust error handling mechanisms ensure that errors are caught and handled gracefully to prevent server crashes or data leaks.
- Validation is implemented at various stages to ensure that user input is sanitized and adheres to specified criteria, enhancing data integrity and security.

### 4. Middleware and Routing
- Middleware functions are used to handle tasks such as token validation, error handling, and request parsing.
- Routes are defined to map HTTP requests to corresponding controller functions, ensuring proper routing and separation of concerns within the application architecture.

## Technology Stack
The Secure Contact Management System is built using the following technologies:
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT), bcrypt
- **Error Handling**: Custom middleware
